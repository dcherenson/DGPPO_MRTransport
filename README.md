**Multi-group multi-drone transportation experiment.**

## Overview

A team of drones carries a shared payload on compliant cables and must deliver
it to a goal pose while avoiding obstacles sensed onboard by LiDAR. The policy
is trained with a CBF-based safe reinforcement learning method and transfers to
hardware **zero-shot**, with no real-world fine-tuning.

Two design choices in the environment carry most of that result, and both are
exposed as command-line flags:

- **Cable compliance is randomized.** The spring stiffness coupling each drone
  to the payload is resampled every episode from
  `[--min-stiffness, --max-stiffness]`, so the policy never overfits to one
  cable model. This is the domain randomization behind the zero-shot transfer.
- **Team size is randomized.** The number of active drones is resampled every
  episode from `[--min-num-agents, --max-num-agents]`. One policy therefore
  serves any team size in that range, which is what makes it scalable; at
  evaluation time it also generalizes to team sizes never seen in training.

The simulation is planar: each drone is a double integrator commanded in
acceleration, the payload is a rigid body with position, velocity, orientation
and angular velocity, and each drone observes the world through a 32-beam LiDAR
of which the nearest 8 returns enter the graph.

*One policy, two team sizes: 3 drones (left) and 5 drones (right), both rendered
from the checkpoint in `pretrained/`. Coloured discs are drones, the small
shaded polygon is the payload, dark red discs are obstacles. Both episodes
finish collision-free.*

The learning backbone is **DGPPO** ([MIT-REALM/dgppo](https://github.com/MIT-REALM/dgppo),
ICLR 2025). This repository is derived from it: the upstream README is retained
in full below, and all DGPPO algorithm code remains upstream's under upstream's
LICENSE. Our contribution is the environment, its physics, and the training and
evaluation setup documented here.

## Installation (quick start)

Tested with Python 3.10 and JAX 0.6.2, on CPU and on CUDA GPUs.

```bash
conda create -n dgppo python=3.10 && conda activate dgppo
git clone https://github.com/JY-HIM4U/DGPPO_MRTransport.git
cd DGPPO_MRTransport
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

`requirements.txt` pins `jax[cuda]`. For a CPU-only machine install plain
`jax` instead, or prefix any command below with `JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu`.

Check the install by running the example checkpoint (see [Usage](#usage)) — it
needs no training and finishes in under a minute.

## Usage

### Run the example checkpoint

An example trained policy is included under `pretrained/`, so the environment
and a working policy can be tried without training anything:

```bash
python test.py --path pretrained/VMASCollaborativeTransportLidar_dgppo_seed0 --epi 5 -n 5
```

This is provided as a runnable example of a trained policy, not as a script
that regenerates the tables in the paper. The paper's numbers are aggregate
statistics over many episodes and seeds; a short run like the one above reports
individual episodes and will not match them directly.

As an installation check, the first two episodes at the default seed (1234)
should print roughly `reward -7.780 / cost -0.508` and
`reward -5.675 / cost -0.549`, both at a 100% safe rate. Treat these as a
signal that the install is behaving, not as reported results: reward may drift
by around 0.01 between CPU and GPU.

Because team size is resampled per episode, the `n_real=...` field is the
number of drones actually active, which varies from episode to episode.
Passing a different `-n` runs the same policy at a different team size.

Add `--no-video` to skip rendering, or drop it to write an MP4 per episode
under `<path>/videos/`.

### Train a policy

```bash
python train.py \
  --env VMASCollaborativeTransportLidar --algo dgppo \
  -n 5 --obs 5 --n-rays 32 \
  --min-num-agents 3 --max-num-agents 5 \
  --min-stiffness 0.05 --max-stiffness 0.3 \
  --agent-vertex-constraint 0.2 \
  --steps 200000 --n-env-train 128 --n-env-test 32 \
  --batch-size 16384 --rnn-step 16 \
  --eval-interval 50 --save-interval 50 --seed 0
```

Note that `--max-stiffness 0.3` and `--agent-vertex-constraint 0.2` differ from
the defaults in `make_env`, so pass them explicitly. Every run writes its fully
resolved configuration to `<log_dir>/.../config.yaml`; the config used for the
example checkpoint is in `pretrained/VMASCollaborativeTransportLidar_dgppo_seed0/`.

Runs are logged to Weights & Biases when a connection is available and fall
back to offline mode otherwise. Set `WANDB_MODE=disabled` to turn it off.

### Run the distributed NMPC baseline

The planar ACADOS controller uses a matching nominal kinematic/geometric plant
and a separate evaluator, `test_dnmpc.py`. See [the DNMPC note](DNMPC.md) for the
paper mapping, setup, reproduction command and short validation results.

## Relationship to DGPPO

This repository is a derived copy of
[MIT-REALM/dgppo](https://github.com/MIT-REALM/dgppo), the official JAX
implementation of *Discrete GCBF Proximal Policy Optimization for Multi-agent
Safe Optimal Control* (ICLR 2025), which provides the learning backbone. It is
not a GitHub fork for an administrative reason only: that account already holds
a fork of the upstream repository.

All DGPPO algorithm code here is upstream's, under upstream's terms; see
[LICENSE](LICENSE). Our contribution is the payload-transport environment, its
physics, and the training and evaluation setup documented above.

The upstream environments (`MPE*`, `Lidar*`, `VMASWheel`,
`VMASReverseTransport`) and algorithms (`informarl`, `informarl_lagr`,
`hcbfcrpo`, `dgppo`) are all still present and usable here. They are documented
in the [upstream README](https://github.com/MIT-REALM/dgppo/blob/main/README.md),
which we link to rather than copy so it cannot drift out of date.
